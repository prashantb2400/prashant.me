I have been thinking about starting a blog for a while. Today I finally did it.

My name is Prashant Bhushan. I am a law and tech enthusiast from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. I am learning both fields simultaneously — civil and commercial law on one side, Python and agentic AI on the other.

I do not always know where I am headed. But I keep building, keep reading, keep learning.

This blog will be a place where I write about:

- Law — commercial, civil, and how it intersects with technology
- AI — what I am building, what I am learning
- Geopolitics and economy — things that fascinate me
- Philosophy, literature, music — because life is more than code

If any of this sounds interesting to you, stick around.
