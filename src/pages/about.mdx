    <p>I am a law and tech enthusiast — learning both simultaneously and figuring out where the two worlds meet.</p>
    <p>Commercial and civil law genuinely excites me. At the same time, I am diving deep into Python, prompt engineering, and agentic AI — building things with the help of AI is definitely my thing.</p>
    <p>I do not always know where I am headed, but I keep moving. That feels like enough for now.</p>
    <p>When I am not reading cases or writing code, you will find me lost in geopolitics, economics, philosophy, literature, or music.</p>
    <p>Based in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.</p>
